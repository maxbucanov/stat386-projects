### What is S&P 500 index?
If you are interested in personal finances, then you may have heard about the S&P 500 index. This market index tracks the performans of about 500 companies in the United States. As of the time of writing this post, there are currently 503 companies in this index. this is a great way to diversify your portfolio if you are a long term investor and have no time to pick individual stocks. 

We all know that picking stocks can be risky and that it is important to invest into stable companies if you want to get paid generous dividends over the long perod of time. So, how do we know which companies are stable and less risky? There are several factors that can help investors come up with investment strategies. Some of these factors are: **Price to Earnings (P/E ratio), Price to Sales (P/S ratio), Price-to-book value (P/B ratio)**

### Explaratory data Analysis of the Index
Before starting my analysis there were five major questions that wanted to find answers to. But before we get to them, I wanted to talk a little about data cleaning. As a Data Scientint, the first thing that I look at when working with dataframes is if they need cleaning (dropping duplicates, replacing null values with numbers, converting string to numeric values, removing unneded characters etc.) I got lucky and my dataframe was already pretty clean, the only thing that I needed to do was removing a few characters from columns (such as **$** and **%**)

**_Dataframe Before:_**

**_The code that I used to remove the characters:_**


`
df['Dividend yield'] = df['Dividend yield'].str.replace('%','')
df['Market cap'] = df['Market cap'].str.replace('$','')  
`

**_Dataframe After:_**
