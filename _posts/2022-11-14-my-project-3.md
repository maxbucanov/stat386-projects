## What is S&P 500 index?
If you are interested in personal finance, then you may have heard about the S&P 500 index. This market index tracks the performance of about 500 companies in the United States. As of the time of writing this post, there are currently 503 companies in this index. This is a great way to diversify your portfolio if you are a long-term investor and have no time to pick individual stocks by yourself. 

We all know that picking stocks can be risky and that it is important to invest into stable companies if you want to get paid generous dividends over the long period of time. So, how do we know which companies are stable and less risky? There are several factors that can help investors come up with investment strategies. Some of these factors are: **Price to Earnings (P/E ratio), Price to Sales (P/S ratio), Price-to-book value (P/B ratio)**

## Cleaning Dataset
Before starting my data analysis, I wrote down four questions that wanted to find the answers to. But before we get to them, I wanted to talk a little about data cleaning. As a Data Scientist, the first thing that I look at when working with dataframes is whether they need cleaning (dropping duplicates, replacing null values with numbers, converting string to numeric values, removing unwanted characters, etc.) I got lucky and my dataframe was already pretty clean, the only thing that I needed to do was removing a few characters from columns (such as **$** and **%**).

**_The code that I used to remove unwanted characters:_**
```
df['Dividend yield'] = df['Dividend yield'].str.replace('%','')
df['Market cap'] = df['Market cap'].str.replace('$','')  
```

**_Dataframe Before and After:_**

</p>   


Also, as I was looking at the GICS sectors column in the dataframe, I noticed that **Information Technology** sector was listed twice. When data was entered, someone may have typed "technology" with lower case. In order to fix that issue, I used the code below to rename the value.

```
df['GICS Sector'] = df['GICS Sector'].replace(['Information technology'], 'Information Technology')
```

**_This is what data looked before_**

## Exploratory data Analysis of the Index
As I mentioned above, there were four main questions that I wanted to answer with my data. These questions should help us analyze companies and find out which companies are more stable and pay higher dividends.

**_1. How many sectors are in the S&P 500 index and which sector has the most/least companies_**

Currently the index contains companies in 11 different sectors. The order of these 11 sectors is based on their size. Here is the order 
and the number of companies in each sector:

                           Information Technology    75
                           Industrials               71
                           Financials                67
                           Health Care               64
                           Consumer Discretionary    55
                           Consumer Staples          33
                           Real Estate               31
                           Utilities                 30
                           Materials                 28
                           Communication Services    25
                           Energy                    23
         
 Information Technology sector is the largest sector in the index and has seen a lot of change in the past years because of the fast rise in 
 technology-based companies. Energy sector contains less companies than any other sector.
 
 **_2. Companies in which sector have the highest mean of Dividend yield?_**
 
 S&P 500 index currently consists of **460** large cap companies (market value between $10 billion and $200 billion). But it also includes 
 **42** middle cap companies (market value between $2 billion and $10 billion) and **1** small cap company (market value of less than $250 million.)
 
 Some companies pay dividends, and some don't. Here is the breakdown of average dividend yield in each sector
 
                Large cap Communication Services    1.508
                          Consumer Discretionary    1.124
                          Consumer Staples          2.477
                          Energy                    2.649
                          Financials                2.070
                          Health Care               0.946
                          Industrials               1.321
                          Information Technology    1.092
                          Materials                 2.174
                          Real Estate               3.254
                          Utilities                 2.944
               Mid cap    Communication Services    7.625
                          Consumer Discretionary    2.425
                          Financials                3.132
                          Health Care               1.506
                          Industrials               1.201
                          Information Technology    0.540
                          Materials                 2.140
                          Real Estate               5.475
                          Utilities                 5.810
               Small cap  Consumer Staples          2.820
               
    
From this analysis we can see that in the Large Cap:

**Energy** sector has the highest mean of dividend yield **(2.649%)**  
**Health Care** sector has the smallest mean of dividend yield **(0.946%)**

In the Middle Cap:

**Communication Services** sector has the highest mean of dividend yield **(7.625%)**  
**Information Technology** sector has the smallest mean of dividend yield **(0.540%)**

**Consumer Staples** is the only sector in the Small Cap with dividend yield **(2.820%)**


 **_3. Four companies that meet all recommendations for investors?_**
 
 Like I mentioned in my [repository](https://github.com/maxbucanov/Web-Scraping-Blog) **Price to Earnings (P/E ratio), Price to Sales (P/S ratio), Price-to-book value (P/B ratio)** are 3 big factors that can help investors find stable companies for long term dividends. 
- P/E Ratio should be within 20 - 25 range
- P/S Ratio should be between one or two
- P/B Value should be under 1. Stocks with P/B value under 3 are also often considered by investors.

In order to see if there are any stocks in the index that meet all these requirements, I ran the following Python code:

```
df[(df['Price to TTM earnings'] >= 20) & 
              (df['Price to TTM earnings'] <= 25) &
              (df['Price to TTM sales'] >= 1) & 
              (df['Price to TTM sales'] <= 2) &
              (df['Price to book value'] < 3)]
```

Here is the output that I got:

</p>   

Because I am not a Financial Advisor, I wanted to check if my findings were correct. I searched these four stocks online to see what analysts say about them. 3 out of 4 of these stocks had a **buy** or a **moderate buy** rating. Only Masco Corp stock had a **Hold** rating. I checked what a negative P/B value meant. Turns out that negative P/B value means that a company may have more total liabilities than assets. This doesn't automatically make a stock bad, but it was interesting to find that out.

**4. How do Dividend Yield, P/E ratio, P/S ratio and P/B ratio affect each other?**

Recently, as I have been studying stocks, I noticed that tech companies, especially the younger companies have a higher P/E Ratio. Most tech companies do not pay dividends. Therefore, I started wondering if dividends affect companies' P/E Ratio. To analyze correlation between these factors, I created a heatmap to visualize my findings.

<p align="center" >
   <img src= "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxbucanov/stat386-projects/main/assets/images/Correlation.png" alt="" style="width:600px;"/>
</p> 

Looking at the heatmap, we can see positive correlation between Price to Sales Ratio and Price to Earnings Ratio. This makes sense because the more sales company makes, the bigger earnings it has.
But what we can also see on the heatmap is a negative correlation between Dividend Yield and P/E Ratio, and P/S Ratio.

<p align="center" >
   <img src= "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxbucanov/stat386-projects/main/assets/images/Scatterplot.png" alt="" style="width:600px;"/>
</p> 

On this scatterplot we can see that the companies which pay larger dividends have a smaller P/E Ratio. Now, remember how I mentioned earlier that many tech companies do not pay dividends and have a higher P/E ratio? Now things start to make sense.

Most stable companies no longer need to re-invest all profits into their growth, instead, they pay dividends to their shareholders. These companies tend to have lower growth rate and lower P/E Ratio. Younger companies that focus on their growth, do not pay dividends because they re-invest the profits into their growth, which increases growth rate and P/E Ratio.

## Conclusion
Now that we see statistical analysis of the stock market, we can see which sectors pay higher dividends. Therefore, we can figure out which companies are more stable and could be considered by investors. The more profit companies make, they no longer re invest 100% of it into their growth; instead, they increase their dividends.
We can also see why younger companies have a higher P/E ratio and how it affects their ability to pay dividends.
