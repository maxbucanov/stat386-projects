description: Pandas is an easy way to web scrape the data that you are interested in from a website and then use that data to perform Explaratory Data Analysis. This is how I used this package to get data about 500 US companies from a website.

I have always been interested in the stock market and how our small consitent investments now can pay off in the future, providing us a comfortable retirement. In fact, one of the reasons why I chose to learn Data Science and Machine learning is because I wanted to use the historical stock market data to predict their potential returns in the future.

Today, data scientists can use models to predict how the market may behave short term and/or long term. This is done by exploring data from past stock market behaviors and using that information to forecast what might happen in the future.

There are many ways how we can import data into Jupyter Notebook to analyze the dataset. We can read in a CSV file, or a text file, for example. The only downside with a static file is that it may not work for short term forecast. As we know, stock market can be very volatile and the prices fluctuate every day. This is why getting the data directly from a website where prices get updated daily could be a better solution. This process in Data Science is called Web Scraping.

Web scraping is a great way to get data directly from websites. However, when extracting data, it's important to make sure that we only extract publicly available information. Some data may be protected by regulations, so be very careful and don't scrape personal or confidential data. One of the best ways to check if a website allos scraping is to use the code below:


   <p align="left" >
   import requests 
   </p>
   <p align="left" >
   from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
   </p>
   <p align="left" >
   r=requests.get(" ENTER YOUR URL")
   </p>
   <p align="left" >
   r.status_code 
   </p>
   

   
   If the status code is 200, then you are allowed to scrape the website. If the status code is anything other than 200, then you cannot scrape the website, or are allowed to scrape it partially.
   
   Since the data about stock market is a public data I knew that I shouldn't be having any issues scraping it. However, to be sure, I still used **requests** package to see if the website I selected allowed web scraping. After running the code, the output was 200.
