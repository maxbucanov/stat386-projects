I have always been interested in the stock market and how our small consitent investments now can pay off in the future, providing us a comfortable retirement. In fact, one of the reasons why I chose to learn Data Science and Machine learning is because I wanted to use the historical stock market data to predict their potential returns in the future.

Today, data scientists can use models to predict how the market may behave short term and/or long term. This is done by exploring data from past stock market behaviors and using that information to forecast what might happen in the future.
