Over the last ten years Data Science has been considered a rising career. Since 2012 there has been a 650% increase in data science jobs and between now and 2031 it is projected to grow an additional 36 percent. Since we live in the Information Age, companies are looking for experienced professionals who can help turn raw data into something insightful for a non technical person. 

Although Data Science is an umbrella that includes data analytics, machine learning, data mining and several other related areas, in this post, I would like to focus particularly on Machine Learning and why companies are in such a need of Machine Learning professtionals.

## What is Machine Learning?
Before we get deeper, lets first find out what is Machine Learning (ML). ML is a type of Artificial Intelligence that uses historical data to predict output of an event B, given event A. For instance, have you ever wondered if a smoker who lives in the midwest pays on average more for their health insurance premium than a smoker who lives in the South? Or if a less snowy winter is a signifficant factor of a severe drought in the summer? You can answer all these questions using Machine Learning.

Today there is a number of programming languages that are used in the Data Science field to perform Machine Learning. The most common are Python and R. There are other tools that could be helpful as well, such as SQL, Julia and SAS. However, if you know Python or R, you will be able to successfully perform your job as a Data Scientist.

## How can ML help companies make business decisions?
This summer I worked as an intern for a Tech company doing Business Intelligence. Because of my knowledge of data Science, I also built sevelar models to help find correlation between number of days it took the resolve an issue and predictors such as priority of the ticket, channel through which the ticket was opened etc. Because of that model, we could see the average number of days it took to resolve tickets. Given that information, our data team and management could come up with some business decisions that might improve company performance.

Regression is one of the most common models in Data Science that can help you notice trends, patterns in the dataset. This model can help you find out if a particular predictor positively or negatively affects the variable that you are interested in. Or maybe it has no signifficance.

Let's consider an example of a Franchise company. Looking at the data, what can we tell? Does traffic positively or negatively affect company sales?

This is a linear regression plot. In Statistics and Data Science it is often used to see if there is a relationship between two events. Looking at the plot, we can clearly see that the more traffic the company gets, the more sales it generates. The trendline in this plot is very helpful, as it shows the positive correlation of these two events. (Full analysis of the dataset can be found [here](http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~stine/r_companion/_book/srm.html).)

Today businesses need to understand data because that's where the answers to many questions are found. If you are passionate about solving problems, coding and turning raw data into something interesting and helpful, Data Science can be the field where you can implement your skills and passion.
