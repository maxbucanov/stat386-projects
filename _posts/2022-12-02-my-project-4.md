As you can probably tell by my last two blogs that I like learning and talking about the Stock Market. In my previous blogs I talked about how I scraped the data from a website that contains information about all 500 stocks in the index. Then, using that data, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis to find out how many sectors there are in the index, which sector is the largest and which sector on average has the highest dividend yield. Also, I am sharing my findings on how dividend yield is affected by companies' Price to Earning Ratio.

In this blog, I wanted to discuss a little different topic. A lot of people are scared to invest their money into the stock market because they don't know how it works. The good thing is that you don't need to be a stock wizzard to be pick the best stocks. In fact, it's nearly impossible to guess or predict which company will become the next Amazon, Tesla or Google. Being a long term investor and simply investing your money consistently in S&P 500 for a long period of time, can provide you with a comfortable retirement.

Historically, the market average return has been a little over 10 percent. The market has recovered from all financial crises and keeps going up in value. 
The graph below shows performance of the index over the last 22 years. To create it, I imported my dataset with all years into Tableau and then used filters to only show 22 years worth of data. Then, I used the analysis tool, available in Tableau to visualize the average return the index and forecast its performance for the next couple of years.

## Conclusion 
The graph above explains very well that investing in the US market is a good strategy for long term investors who still have time until their retirement. The graph also shows that the market returns are not linear. There are years when it performs very well, and there are years when it drops significantly due to unforseen circumstances (financial crisis, pandemics etc). You can see that in 2008, the market dropped by 37%. However, the economy always recovers and the average return of 10% is actually really good for those who still have 20-30 years until they hit their retirement age. (Not a financial advice)

The light blue line with the shaded area shows the estimated returns with a 95% prediction interval for the next couple of years. The numbers may very, because the market is always affected by the economy. It may drop, or may go up. 
In spite of its yearly performance, the US stock market has recovered from all crises in the past and has an average return of 10% regardless of its negative returns.
