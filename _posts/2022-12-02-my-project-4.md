As you can probably tell by my last two blogs that I like learning and talking about the Stock Market. In my previous blogs I talked about how I scraped the data from a website that contains information about all 500 stocks in the index. Then, using that data, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis to see which sector on average has the highest dividend yield. Also, if you are curious how dividend yield is affected by companies' Price to Earning Ratio, all of this you can read here:

In this blog, I wanted to discuss a little different topic. A lot of people are scared to invest their money into the stock market because they don't know how it works. The good thing is that you don't need to be a stock wizzard to be pick the best stocks, because it's nearly impossible to guess which stock will be the next Amazon or Google. Being a long term investor and simply investing your money consistently in S&P 500 for a long period of time, can provide you with a comfortable retirement.

Historically, the market average return has been a little over 10 percent. The market has recovered from all financial crisises and keeps going up. Lets look at the graph below.
