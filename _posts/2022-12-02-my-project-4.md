As you can probably tell by my last two blogs that I like learning and talking about the Stock Market. In my previous blogs I talked about how I scraped the data from a website that contains information about all 500 stocks in the index. Then, using that data, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis to see which sector on average has the highest dividend yield. Also, if you are curious how didvend yield is affected by companies' Price to Earning Ratio, all of this you can read here:
